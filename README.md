# COM373 Group Project
Group Project For Coursework 1


The	assignment	is	a	team-based	piece	of	work.	Teams	should	self-select	and	be	of	not	
less	than	2	people	and	not	more	than	4	people

Bigtown	civic	centre	is	occasionally	used	to	host	concerts.	These	concerts	are	one-off	events	held	
now	and	again.	You	have	been	asked	to	develop	a	graphical	Java	application	to	assist	in	tracking
bookings	for	such	concerts.	Your	application	should	satisfy	the	following	requirements:
1. An	administrator	will	have	sole	access	to	the	booking	system. The	system	should	be	standalone
– no	internet	access	is	required	for	this	initial	system.
2. The	administrator	will	handle	all	bookings	either	by	phone	or	by	arriving	in	person.
3. The	system	will	only need	to	handle	one	concert at	a	time.	
4. The	system	will	only	need	to	handle	a	concert for	one	specific	date	– i.e.	there	is	no	need	to	
keep	track	of	seat	bookings	on different	dates	for	the	one	concert.
5. The	system	must	enable	the	administrator	to	create	a	new	concert and	to	provide	a	title	for	
that	event	and	its	scheduled	date.	This	information	should	be	saved	to	file	so	that	it	can	be	
recalled	in	case	the	application should	be	stopped	and	started	again.
6. The	administrator	must	be	able	to	set	a	price	for	seats	in	each	of	the	“Gold”,	“Silver”	and	
“Bronze”	areas	of	the	hall.	This	information	must	also	be	stored	to	file	and	recalled	if	the	
application	is	stopped	and	started	again.
7. The	system	should	provide	a	graphical	interface	showing	the	seating	plan	for	the	hall,	as	
depicted	in	figure	1	below.	This	seating	plan	is	fixed	for	all	concerts	– i.e.	it	does	not need	to	
be	configurable.
